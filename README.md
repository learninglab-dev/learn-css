# LL Learn CSS

Welcome to the CSS tutorials repo! Here we plan to post homegrown CSS tutorials and also to collect our favorites from around the internets.

## Navigating

This repo has three sections:  
1. **basics**
2. **tutorials**
3. **pages**

### 1. basics

Here you'll find a [glossary](./basics/glossary.md) and a [primer](./basics/syntax-primer.md) on CSS syntax. Please contribute to the glossary as you learn new CSS terms!

You'll also find a [setup](./basics/setup.md) doc, which lays out the basics setup needed for trying out each of the tutorials here. For example, you'll always need some boilerplate HTML to style. In addition, for LL folks working on [the-resources](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources), there's a special [resources-setup](./basics/resources-setup.md) on how to get started with these tutorials in that repo.

Finally, in basics you'll also find our [links to outside resources](./basics/links.md). Again, please contribute when you find good things!

### 2. tutorials

There are no surprises here! This folder contains all the tutorials. Below is the list of them in a recommended order, if you're planning to go through all of them. However, each one is modular, and you should be able to jump to a particular topic:

1. How do I...
  - [make-text-pretty](./tutorials/text-styling-basics/text-styling-basics.md)
  - [size-and-format-images](./tutorials/size-format-images)
  - [center-text-on-image](./tutorials/center-text-on-image/center-text-on-image.md)
  - [add-my-own-fonts](./tutorials/add-my-own-fonts/add-my-own-fonts.md)
  - [make-a-spinning-logo](./tutorials/make-a-spinning-logo)

2. CSS Concepts
  - [box-model]()
  - [flexbox-layout]()
  - [css-grid]()
  - [intro-to-selectors]()
  - [why-cascading]()


### 3. pages

This is a work in progress. Perhaps someday we'll have a Github Pages version of this repo for viewing the tutorials. Perhaps we'll move them over to an LL site and get rid of this section. :wink:
