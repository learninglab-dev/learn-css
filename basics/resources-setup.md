# [`the-resources`](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources) Setup

Use this guide if you're looking to try out these CSS tutorials within `the-resources` project.

**Note:** Not every tutorial in this repo works with `the-resources`-- *yet!* Some require that you have direct access to the HTML. Tutorials that require you to edit the HTML will say so at the top.

## Video Walkthrough

Watching this quick video may be enough to get you up and running:

## List of steps

But here are the steps, if you prefer the written word. :smile:

1. Open [`the-resources`](https://github.com/learninglab-dev/the-resources) repo and navigate into the `/public/stylesheets` folder.

2. Click `Create new file` and give your file an apt name. This could be your name or the name of your theme. Just make sure your filename has no spaces, capital letters, or other punctuation and that you add the extension `.css` when you create it.

3. Write your tutorial CSS directly in the new file editor! We'll commit it when you're finished.

  **Note**: Because `the-resources` is live on the internets, you won't be able to see your styles until someone on the LL staff approves your pull request. We know this is a bummer! But we want to make sure only things you're proud of end up online. If you'd like to have live previews of your styles and are willing to spend a bit of extra time setting up, you can follow the instructions under [Running a Local Server](#running-a-local-server) below.

4. When you've completed the tutorial, it's time to commit your CSS file. To do this, scroll down to the bottom until you see "Commit new file". In the top box there add a commit message explaining what you're adding to the repo. A good template is "Add new stylesheet [name of your styles]". Then select "Create a new branch for this commit" and name your branch. Again, a good name is something like "[your first name]-[your last initial]-styles". Remember there should be no spaces and no capital letters in the name of your branch. Finally click `Propose new file`.

5. That should have taken you to the "Open a pull request" screen. Here you can assign reviewers by clicking the little gear by Reviewers on the right, if you want someone specific to look at your PR. Otherwise, just click `Create pull request` to submit it. We'll check it out and get back to you shortly!

5. Once you're received word that your pull request has been approved and merged, check out [resources.learninglab.xyz/styled](https://resources.learninglab.xyz/styled) to view all the markdown pages with your new styles!

## Running a Local Server

When you're ready to do more with styling, you can run a local copy of `resources.learninglab.xyz`! This will allow you to view your changes immediately in the browser without submitting PRs or waiting for approval. Of course, you should still submit a PR when you've got something you're happy with, so your new styles can go live on the full site.

To setup a local server, follow these steps:
