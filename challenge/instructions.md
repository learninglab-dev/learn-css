# Challenge Instructions

So you're ready to tackle the challenge-- great! The premise is straightforward: your goal is to recreate the layout of a [Medium post](https://medium.com/actualize-network/modern-css-explained-for-dinosaurs-5226febe3525) on CSS.

You can find a snapshot of just the portion you'll be recreating in [goal.png](./goal.png):
![goal](./goal.png)

To get you started, we've added the text content to [starter.html](./starter.html). You'll want to download that file (or copy and paste the html from there into a new file on your computer) as your first step. Open your new HTML file in a browser, and you should see essentially unformatted text. Then you can either create a `styles.css` and update the `<link>` in the HTML `<head>` to point to your new file or simply work in your browser's style editor.

Everything you need to know to recreate this layout _should be_ in these tutorials, especially the tutorial on making rows and columns with [flexbox](../tutorials/flexbox/flexbox.md). If you think this isn't right, definitely let us know what's missing! If you need help, we've also provided a graphical [hint](./hint.png) about how to structure the final layout, and you can peek at the [final html](./solution/index.html).

Finally, some images are provided for you in the [assets](./assets) folder, so you don't need to track anything down.

### Good luck! :smile:
