        <span class='highlight'>CSS is strangely considered both one of the easiest and one of the hardest languages to learn as a web developer.</span> It’s certainly easy enough to get started with it — you define style properties and values to apply to specific elements, and…that’s pretty much all you need to get going! However, it gets tangled and complicated to organize CSS in a meaningful way for larger projects. Changing any line of CSS to style an element on one page often leads to unintended changes for elements on other pages.
